# About 

<sup><sub>Excuse the mess - still under construction. </sub></sup>

**GM, GM!** I'm thrilled to share my deep involvement in the fascinating world of Web3 with you. While I may not be a hardcore developer, I'm no stranger to code—I can navigate my way around it comfortably. With a degree in [Computer Engineering](https://www.csulb.edu/college-of-engineering/computer-engineering-computer-science) and a career dedicated to the tech industry, I've played a significant role in building both [Web1 and Web2](https://cv.kumeda.com) infrastructure, and now I'm eager to continue shaping the future of Web3.

Throughout my professional journey, I've had the opportunity to work in diverse environments, ranging from dynamic dot-com startups to large Fortune 100 companies. This exposure has equipped me with a versatile skill set and the ability to adapt seamlessly to different work cultures. If you're on the lookout for a self-motivated individual with a diverse background, I'd love to connect with you. Let's explore how my expertise can contribute to your organization's success. Feel free to [reach out](/contact) to me, and together, we can discuss how I can assist you in achieving your goals!
