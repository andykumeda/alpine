I'm an OG Web1 technologist based in the charming foothill town of [Sierra Madre, California](https://goo.gl/maps/SVpYTgqJGhFryxPm7). When I'm not jumping down the rabbit hole of the newest [Web3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web3) protocol, I'm out exploring the trails preparing for my next [ultramarathon](https://andyk.run), or capturing stunning vistas through the [lens](https://andykumeda.com/photography/) of my Sony A1.
  
<br>
<br>

Beyond my tech and [running](https://andyk.run) adventures, you can often find me behind the turntables at [local dive bars](https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-buccaneer-lounge-sierra-madre), spinning a [curated mix](https://andykumeda.com/music) of 80s vinyl that infuse the room with nostalgia and contagious energy.

<br>

Curious to learn more about my [Web3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web3) background? Head over to my *[About](/about)* page for the TL;DR, or [here](https://andykumeda.com) for the [normies'](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/crypto-nft-twitter-discord-guide.html) version. Don't hesitate to [reach out](/contact) if you have any questions, or simply want to [connect](/contact). You can also find me on my social media channels below.
